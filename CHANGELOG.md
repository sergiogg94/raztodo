# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Docker wrapper scripts (`docker/rt-docker.sh` for Linux/macOS and `docker/rt-docker.ps1` for Windows) that delegate `rt` commands to a persistent Docker container automatically, so you can use the tool without installing it on the host

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Fixed optional `argcomplete` import at CLI startup to work correctly when shell completion support is not installed
- Prevented internal exception messages from being exposed by the web explain streaming endpoint

### Changed
- Updated the project description and wording in the README

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Added `rt explain` command (and corresponding web UI modal with Summary / Deep Analysis / Action Plan modes) powered by a new `ExplainTaskUseCase` and Ollama LLM integration
- Added `get_task` method to `TaskRepository` (and SQLite implementation) for fetching a single task by ID
- Added `all` extra in `pyproject.toml` to install web + completion dependencies together
- Added test coverage for `ExplainTaskUseCase` factory wiring, the new `Settings.resolve_db_path` / `data_dir` behavior, and the FastAPI app's index route, static mount, and router registration (including the new `explain` route)

### Changed
- Refactored `Settings`: replaced `db_path` property and private `_resolve_data_dir` with a public `resolve_data_dir()` helper, a `data_dir` property that now creates the directory on access, and a new `resolve_db_path()` method for resolving relative/absolute DB paths
- `AppContainer` and `sqlite_connection_factory` now work with a resolved `Path` instead of a raw db name string, with path resolution centralized in `Settings`
- Reorganized web static assets into `static/css/`, `static/js/`, and `static/img/` subfolders
- Replaced `ui.py`'s `render_index_html()` with direct `FileResponse` serving of `templates/index.html`, returning a 500 error if the template file is missing
- Reworked test suites for settings/connection (`TestDefaultDataDir` → `TestSettings`) and the web app (`test_app.py`) to match the new `Settings`-based path resolution and file-based index serving
- Bumped `fastapi` to 0.138.2 and `raztint` to 0.8.2

### Removed
- Removed `tests/presentation/web/test_ui.py` along with the deleted `ui.py` module
- Removed standalone `default_data_dir()` function and its tests (folded into `Settings`)

### Changed

* Redesigned the web UI with a side panel layout for inline task editing, keeping the task list visible while editing
* Split `ui.py` into separate static files: `static/style.css`, `static/app.js`, and `templates/index.html`, served via FastAPI `StaticFiles`
* Migrated `ruff` and `ty` configuration out of `pyproject.toml` into dedicated `ruff.toml` and `ty.toml` files
* Added `infrastructure/version.py` as the single source of truth for the package version across CLI and web
* Updated README and `pyproject.toml` metadata

* Fixed an infinite loop caused by `renderTasks` being called recursively instead of `renderTask` in the task list renderer
